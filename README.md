# My Holiday — Urlaubsplaner

A vacation day planner for Germany. Plan your annual vacation days with automatic work-day calculation that excludes weekends and public holidays for your chosen state (Bundesland).

## Features

- **Configurable budget** — set your annual vacation allowance (default: 30 days)
- **Carry-over tracker** — enter days carried over from last year; Dashboard shows how many have been used, how many remain, and warns when the March 31 deadline approaches
- **All 16 German states** — select your Bundesland; public holidays computed via [`feiertagejs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/feiertagejs)
- **Half-day booking** — mark single days as half days (0.5 instead of 1.0); Dec 24 and Dec 31 always count as 0.5
- **Smart work-day counting** — only counts Monday–Friday, excludes weekends and public holidays; periods spanning multiple years are correctly clipped to the selected year
- **Four views** — Dashboard summary, year grid (12 mini calendars), full month calendar, and a sortable list
- **Click-to-plan** — select date ranges directly in the month view; click existing vacations to edit or delete
- **Live work-day preview** — the add/edit modal shows exactly how many work days a date range consumes
- **Overlap prevention** — prevents booking a vacation that conflicts with an existing one
- **CSV import/export** — backup your data or edit it in Excel; semicolon-delimited UTF-8 with BOM
- **Dark mode** — light, dark, or auto (follows system preference)
- **English & German** — switch language in settings, all UI translated
- **School holidays** — subtle overlay showing school breaks for your state
- **Undo/redo** — Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y or toast notification with undo button
- **Persistent storage** — all data saved to your browser's `localStorage`, no backend required
- **Responsive** — works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

## How to Use

### Starting the app

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Opens at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Running tests

```bash
npm test          # single run
npm run test:watch  # watch mode
```

Tests follow the RED-GREEN principle — see [`RULES.md`](./RULES.md).

### Views

| Tab | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Übersicht** | Summary cards (used, remaining, total days), progress bar, carry-over tracker, list of upcoming vacations — click any upcoming entry to edit it |
| **Jahresansicht** | 12 mini month calendars. Full vacation days are filled red, half days have a striped pattern. Public holidays in red text. Click any month to jump to its detail view. |
| **Monatsansicht** | Full-size calendar for a single month. Navigate with `‹` `›` arrows. Public holidays are labeled. |
| **Liste** | Table of all planned vacations with date range, work-day count, note, and edit/delete buttons. |

### Settings

Click the ⚙️ gear icon in the navigation bar to open settings:

- **Urlaubstage pro Jahr** — set your annual vacation budget (1–60, default: 30)
- **Übertrag vom Vorjahr** — auto-calculated when switching years (unused days from the previous year); can be overridden manually (0–60); see [Carry-over tracker](#carry-over-tracker) below
- **Bundesland** — choose your state to get the correct public holidays (default: Hessen)

### Adding a vacation

1. Click **+ Urlaub planen** (on Dashboard or List view), or
2. In **Monatsansicht**, click a start date, then click an end date — the modal opens with the range pre-filled
3. Enter an optional note (e.g. "Sommerurlaub")
4. Toggle **Halber Tag** for single-day bookings (e.g. a doctor's appointment)
5. The modal shows the live work-day count
6. Click **Urlaub planen** to save

The modal prevents booking a vacation that overlaps with an existing one — an error message is shown if the date range conflicts.

### Half-day rules

| Rule | Counts as |
|------|-----------|
| User-toggled "Halber Tag" (single day only) | 0.5 |
| December 24 (Christmas Eve) | 0.5 |
| December 31 (New Year's Eve) | 0.5 |
| Normal work day | 1.0 |
| Weekend or public holiday | 0 |

Half-day toggles are disabled for multi-day ranges. When toggling half-day on with a multi-day selection, the end date auto-collapses to match the start date.

### Editing or deleting

- Click any upcoming vacation on the **Dashboard** to open the edit modal directly
- Click any existing vacation block in the **month view** to open the edit modal
- Use the ✎ (edit) and ✕ (delete) buttons in the **list view** or in the month view's vacation list
- All changes persist automatically

### Carry-over tracker

In Germany, unused vacation days can typically be carried over into the new year but must be used by **March 31** (this is the statutory default; some contracts allow until June 30 — the app uses March 31).

**Automatic calculation:** when you navigate to a new year (e.g. 2026 → 2027), the app automatically computes carry-over as `max(0, annual budget − days used in the previous year)`. If you had no vacation data for the previous year the carry-over defaults to 0.

**Manual override:** open **Settings** (⚙️) and edit the **Übertrag vom Vorjahr** field (0–60). The override persists until you switch years again.

Once set, the Dashboard shows a carry-over card below the main progress bar:

- Progress bar: how many carry-over days have been consumed (vacations booked on or before March 31 count against carry-over first)
- Remaining days and deadline date
- **Warning** — if carry-over days are still unused and March 31 is ≤30 days away
- **Expired** — if March 31 has passed with unused carry-over days (displayed in red)

Carry-over days are "used first": work days from vacations before the deadline reduce the carry-over bucket before touching your regular annual budget.

### Changing years

Use the `‹ 2026 ›` arrows in the navigation bar. Data is stored per year — switch back and forth without losing plans.

### Import / Export

- **📤 Export** — downloads a CSV file (`urlaub-2026.csv`) with columns: `Startdatum;Enddatum;Notiz;Halber Tag;Arbeitstage`
- **📥 Import** — reads a CSV file (semicolon-delimited, UTF-8). Accepts `YYYY-MM-DD`, `DD.MM.YYYY`, and `MM/DD/YYYY` date formats. Replaces all existing periods after confirmation.
- The `Arbeitstage` column is computed on export for reference but ignored on import (work days are always derived from the date range).

### Public holidays

The app uses the [`feiertagejs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/feiertagejs) library to compute public holidays for all 16 German states. Each state has its own set:

| State | Extra holidays (beyond the 9 nationwide) |
|-------|------------------------------------------|
| Baden-Württemberg | Heilige Drei Könige, Fronleichnam, Allerheiligen |
| Bayern | Heilige Drei Könige, Fronleichnam, Mariä Himmelfahrt, Allerheiligen |
| Berlin | Internationaler Frauentag |
| Brandenburg | Reformationstag |
| Bremen | Reformationstag |
| Hamburg | Reformationstag |
| Hessen | Fronleichnam |
| Mecklenburg-Vorpommern | Reformationstag |
| Niedersachsen | Reformationstag |
| Nordrhein-Westfalen | Fronleichnam, Allerheiligen |
| Rheinland-Pfalz | Fronleichnam, Allerheiligen |
| Saarland | Fronleichnam, Mariä Himmelfahrt, Allerheiligen |
| Sachsen | Reformationstag, Buß- und Bettag |
| Sachsen-Anhalt | Heilige Drei Könige, Reformationstag |
| Schleswig-Holstein | Reformationstag |
| Thüringen | Weltkindertag, Reformationstag |

Nationwide holidays (all states): Neujahr, Karfreitag, Ostermontag, Tag der Arbeit, Christi Himmelfahrt, Pfingstmontag, Tag der Deutschen Einheit, 1. Weihnachtstag, 2. Weihnachtstag.

### Data Model

```typescript
VacationType = 'urlaub' | 'bildungsurlaub' | 'kur' | 'sabbatical'
  | 'unbezahlterUrlaub' | 'mutterschaftsurlaub' | 'elternzeit' | 'sonderurlaub'

VacationPeriod {
  id: string;          // Unique ID (UUID in v2, generated)
  startDate: string;   // ISO date YYYY-MM-DD
  endDate: string;     // ISO date YYYY-MM-DD
  note: string;        // Optional label
  halfDay?: boolean;   // Single-day half-day booking (Dec 24/31 always count as 0.5)
  type?: VacationType; // Vacation type (defaults to 'urlaub')
}

// State (persisted) — 🆕 = v2 additions
{
  year: number;                    // Currently selected year
  totalDays: number;               // Annual vacation budget (default: 30)
  carryOverDays: number;           // Days carried over from previous year
  state: GermanState;              // Bundesland code (default: 'HE')
  language: Language;              // 'de' | 'en'
  theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'auto';
  periods: VacationPeriod[];       // All planned vacations
  view: 'dashboard' | 'year' | 'month' | 'list';
  selectedMonth: number;           // 0–11, active month in month view
  🆕 employmentStartDate: string;  // Employment start (ISO date; empty = not set)
  🆕 employmentEndDate: string;    // Employment end (ISO date; empty = still employed)
  🆕 carryOverDeadline: string;    // Month-day, e.g. '03-31'
  🆕 carryOverMaxDays: number | null; // null = no cap
  🆕 bildungsUrlaubDays: number;   // Bildungsurlaub budget (0 = disabled)
}
```

### State Flow

- **Zustand store** is the single source of truth
- The `persist` middleware syncs the entire state to `localStorage` under the key `my-holiday-storage`
- All mutations go through store actions: `addPeriod`, `updatePeriod`, `removePeriod`, `importData`, `setState`, `setTotalDays`, `setCarryOverDays`
- Work-day counts are **derived** (computed on render, not stored) — this guarantees they stay correct even if the holiday data or counting logic changes
- Vacation day coverage is computed as `Set<string>` of ISO date strings for fast lookup in calendar views

### Key Design Decisions

**1. Work-day counting is always live-computed**

Work days are never stored. `countVacationWorkDays(period, state)` iterates day-by-day, applying weights:
- 1.0 for normal work days
- 0.5 for user-toggled half days (single-day only)
- 0.5 for Dec 24 and Dec 31 (always, regardless of user toggle)
- 0 for weekends and public holidays

This ensures correctness even if the app is updated with new logic later.

**2. No backend — pure client-side**

The app has no server component. All data lives in `localStorage`. This keeps deployment trivial (static HTML/JS/CSS) and works offline.

**3. Single CSS file with design tokens**

All styles live in `App.css`. The design system from `DESIGN.md` is implemented as CSS custom properties in `index.css`:

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| `--color-primary` | `#db001b` |
| `--color-bg` | `#ffffff` |
| `--color-text` | `#151f27` |
| `--color-text-secondary` | `#586674` |
| `--color-border` | `#f4f8fc` |
| `--spacing-unit` | `20px` |
| `--radius` | `6px` |

No runtime CSS-in-JS library is used — this keeps the bundle small.

**4. View switching without a router**

Four views share the same URL. The active view is a piece of Zustand state (`view`). This avoids routing complexity for what is essentially a single-screen tool, and makes view state survive page reloads (since it's persisted).

**5. Pro-rata vacation entitlement (§ 4 BUrlG)**

When employment does not span a full calendar year, vacation entitlement is calculated pro-rata:
- **6+ complete months** in the year → full entitlement
- **< 6 months** → `floor(months / 12 × totalDays)` per complete calendar month

Only complete calendar months count (a month where you were employed from the 1st to the last day). Partial months are ignored.

Leave reductions (§ 17 BUrlG / § 17 BEEG): unpaid leave (`unbezahlterUrlaub`) and parental leave (`elternzeit`) each reduce entitlement by `1/12` per full calendar month of leave. Partial months never combine across periods.

**6. Vacation types**

Eight vacation types distinguish how time off affects your budget:

| Type | Budget impact |
|------|--------------|
| `urlaub` | Consumes main vacation budget |
| `bildungsurlaub` | Separate counter (default 0, enabled in settings) |
| `kur`, `sabbatical`, `mutterschaftsurlaub`, `sonderurlaub` | Informational only |
| `unbezahlterUrlaub`, `elternzeit` | Reduces vacation entitlement (§ 17) |

**7. iCal export**

Vacation periods can be exported as RFC 5545 `.ics` files for calendar apps (Apple Calendar, Outlook, Google Calendar). All-day events with correct `DTSTART`/`DTEND`, proper text escaping, and line folding.

**8. Click-to-select in month view**

Instead of a traditional date range picker, the month view uses a two-click flow:
1. Click a day → selection mode activates (hint banner appears)
2. Click another day → modal opens with the range pre-filled

Clicking an existing vacation block opens the edit modal directly. This keeps vacation planning fast and visual.

**9. feiertagejs for holiday computation**

All public holidays are computed via [`feiertagejs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/feiertagejs), a zero-dependency TypeScript library that handles all 16 German states with their specific holidays, movable Easter-dependent dates, and even region-specific holidays (e.g. Augsburger Friedensfest).

**10. CSV import/export with handwritten parser**

CSV files use UTF-8 with BOM for correct Excel handling, semicolons as delimiters (German Excel convention), and support flexible date formats on import (`YYYY-MM-DD`, `DD.MM.YYYY`, `MM/DD/YYYY`). The parser is handwritten (~80 lines) — no library dependency.

**11. Vacation period display**

- Full vacation days are highlighted with a solid `--color-primary` background
- Half-day vacations show a diagonal stripe pattern in the year view and a `(½)` suffix in lists
- In the month view, only the **first day** of a multi-day vacation shows the note label (prevents visual clutter)
- Year view mini calendars show all vacation days as filled squares — weekends within a vacation period are included visually, but not counted

## Design System

This project follows the design system documented in [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md), automatically extracted from the Syskoplan Reply website:

- **Background**: `#ffffff` — light, clean canvas
- **Primary accent**: `#db001b` — used for CTAs, active states, progress bars, and vacation highlights
- **Text**: `#151f27` (headings and body)
- **Secondary text**: `#586674` (captions, muted elements)
- **Borders**: `#f4f8fc` (subtle dividers)
- **Spacing**: based on a `20px` grid unit
- **Border radius**: `6px` on interactive elements
- **Shadows**: mid-level (`0px 2px 10px -3px`) for cards, high-level (`0px 0px 18px 0px`) for modals
- **Typography**: system sans-serif stack with weight 500 for headings

## Responsive Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Behavior |
|---|---|
| > 1024px | Full desktop layout: 4-column year grid, 3-column stats |
| 640–1024px | Tablet: 3-column year grid, 2-column stats |
| < 640px | Mobile: 2-column year grid, single-column stats, stacked nav, reduced font sizes |
