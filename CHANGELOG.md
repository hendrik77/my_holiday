# Changelog

All notable changes to My Holiday.

---

## v2.3.4 (2026-06-02)

### Added
- **`holiday delete <id>`** — delete a vacation period by id or unique prefix (from `holiday list`); `--json` returns a structured confirmation. Completes CLI CRUD (`add` / `list` / `change` / `delete`)

---

## v2.3.3 (2026-06-01)

### Added
- **`holiday change <id>`** — edit an existing vacation period (partial update via `PUT /periods/:id`): change `--start`/`--end`/`--type`/`--note` or toggle `--half-day`/`--no-half-day`; only the flags you pass are sent. Accepts a unique id prefix, and `holiday list` now shows a short **ID** column to copy from

### Changed
- **`holiday add` — `--end` is now optional** — omit it for a single-day (or `--half-day`) vacation; it defaults to `--start`
- **Release builds arm64 on native runners** — multi-arch images are now built without QEMU (amd64 on `ubuntu-latest`, arm64 on `ubuntu-24.04-arm`), fixing the emulated `better-sqlite3` build flakiness and speeding releases

---

## v2.3.2 (2026-06-01)

### Added
- **`holiday --help <command>`** — per-command help is now reachable in flag-first order too (commander ignored the trailing command before); `holiday <command> --help` and `holiday help <command>` remain equivalent
- **Richer per-command help** — each command's help shows a curated usage signature (e.g. `holiday add --start <YYYY-MM-DD> --end <YYYY-MM-DD> [--type <type>] …`), an example, and the global options (`--json` / `--api` / `--token`)

### Fixed
- **CLI runs standalone** — `build:cli` now bundles its only dependency (`commander`) into `dist-cli/my-holiday.js` instead of leaving it external, so the single file runs anywhere with just Node (no `node_modules` required); previously it threw `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` when run outside a full checkout

### Changed
- **README**: documented the GHCR pre-built/multi-arch image, a copy-paste `MY_HOLIDAY_API_URL` export, the self-contained CLI bundle, the `--help <command>` forms, and a more robust zsh completion install hint (`mkdir -p` the target dir)

---

## v2.3.1 (2026-06-01)

### Added
- **Multi-arch Docker images** — the release now publishes `linux/amd64` **and** `linux/arm64`, so ARM hosts (Apple Silicon, Raspberry Pi, ARM NAS) pull a native image instead of emulating amd64. `docker pull` auto-selects the host architecture
- **README: pre-built image instructions** — documents pulling/running/updating `ghcr.io/hendrik77/my_holiday` from GHCR

### Changed
- **CI now builds the Docker image on every PR** — Dockerfile / native-addon (`better-sqlite3`) build failures are caught before merge, instead of only at release-tag time

---

## v2.3.0 (2026-06-01)

### Added
- **Command-line interface (`holiday`)** — HTTP-only CLI for power users and AI agents, talking to the same REST API as the web app (local or remote). Commands: `list`, `add`, `remaining`, `export`, `migrate`, `calendar`, `today`, `completion`. Global `--api` / `--token` (or `MY_HOLIDAY_API_URL` / `MY_HOLIDAY_API_TOKEN`), `--json` on every command, exit codes `0`/`1`/`2`. Bundled to `dist-cli/` via esbuild; `npm link` exposes a global `holiday` command
- **`holiday calendar`** — terminal calendar: full-year German 12-month grid (or one month via `--month`) shading vacation, half-days, public holidays and weekends; TTY-gated ANSI color (`--no-color` / `NO_COLOR` respected)
- **`holiday today`** — one-line status: remaining days plus the active/next vacation (`--json` for structured output)
- **`holiday completion <bash\|zsh\|fish>`** — shell completion scripts; `--type` values sourced from the canonical `VACATION_TYPES` so they cannot drift
- **New server endpoints** — `GET /api/v1/remaining`, `GET /api/v1/export.csv`, `POST /api/v1/import`, and `GET /api/v1/holidays?year=[&state=]` (public holidays as `{date,name}`), centralising entitlement / CSV / holiday computation server-side for all clients
- **`export --bom`** — opt-in UTF-8 BOM on CLI CSV output for Excel
- **Architecture Decision Records** — `docs/adr/` with ADR-0001 (HTTP-only CLI transport), ADR-0002 (server-side computation), and ADR-0003 (dedicated `/holidays` endpoint)
- **Build & type-check scripts** — `build:cli`, `build:server`, `typecheck:cli`, `typecheck:server`, and a combined `typecheck`; a `pretest` hook builds the CLI bundle so the suite is self-contained

### Changed
- **`GET /api/v1/periods`** now returns a server-computed `workDays` per period (from the configured Bundesland); the CLI `list` renders it, falling back to the calendar-day span only when absent
- **CSV/ICS refactor** — `formatCSV` extracted into a browser-free `src/utils/csv.ts` shared by the web download and `/export.csv`; `downloadSingleICS` moved to `src/utils/icsDownload.ts` to keep `ics.ts` DOM-free
- **CLI command renamed** from `my-holiday` to `holiday` (the `bin` entry); the bundle carries a `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang so it runs without a `node` prefix once linked
- **Dependency updates** (Dependabot) — `react`/`react-dom`, `zustand`, `better-sqlite3`, `typescript-eslint`, and the dev-tooling group bumped to their latest minor/patch versions
- **`package.json` version** set to `2.3.0` so `holiday --version` reports the real release

---

## v2.2.0 (2026-05-19)

### Added
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — dedicated architecture document extracted from README; covers tech stack, file structure, REST API, data model, state flow, and key design decisions
- **Vacation type in CSV export/import** — `Type` column added to `Start Date;End Date;Note;Type;Half Day;Work Days` format; valid type keys are round-tripped on import; unknown values fall back to `urlaub`

### Changed
- **README restructure** — screenshots added, Features grouped into categories, sections reordered (Features before Setup, Architecture replaced by link to ARCHITECTURE.md, AI Development Team moved to bottom), "Running tests" renamed to "Development"
- **CSV column headers** — both DE and EN locales now use English column names for consistent round-tripping

---

## v2.1.0 (2026-05-16)

### Added
- **Docker distribution** — multi-stage `Dockerfile` (build + runtime), `docker-compose.yml`, `.dockerignore`; single container serves frontend + API on port 3001
- **`build:server` script** — esbuild bundles server TypeScript to ESM for Docker runtime
- **SECURITY.md** — vulnerability reporting policy
- **`.env.example`** — documented server environment variables
- **Dependabot** — weekly npm dependency updates grouped by dev-tooling vs runtime
- **GitHub Actions CI** — lint + unit tests + E2E on every push and pull request

### Fixed
- **Vacation colour hidden in light mode** — when a calendar cell had both `.vacation` and `.school-holiday` classes, the school-holiday `background` shorthand erased the vacation colour; fixed by splitting into `background-color` / `background-image`

---

## v2.0.0 (2026-05-01)

### Added
- **First-run wizard** — 4-step onboarding modal shown on clean install
  - Step 1: Employment dates (start, end, "still employed" toggle)

  - Step 3: Annual vacation days (1–60)
  - Step 4: Carry-over policy (deadline March 31 / June 30, optional max cap)
- 7 component tests for FirstRunWizard
- **8 vacation types** — `urlaub`, `bildungsurlaub`, `kur`, `sabbatical`, `unbezahlterUrlaub`, `mutterschaftsurlaub`, `elternzeit`, `sonderurlaub`
- Colour-coded type badges in Dashboard upcoming list
- Bildungsurlaub counter (own budget, configurable in settings)

- **iCal export** — client-side RFC 5545 `.ics` download; server endpoint `GET /api/v1/export.ics?year=YYYY`
- Per-period iCal download button in list view
- **Express + SQLite backend** — REST API with 7 endpoints: CRUD for vacation periods, settings, iCal export
- `better-sqlite3` database at `data/my-holiday.db` with `periods` and `settings` tables
- `changed_at` tracking on every period mutation
- 28 supertest + DB unit tests
- **Migration script** — `npx tsx scripts/migrate-v1.ts ./urlaub-2026.csv` imports v1 CSV → v2 SQLite; idempotent
- 8 migration tests (valid CSV, idempotency, empty file, missing header, corrupt dates)
- **Playwright E2E smoke tests** — 5 tests: wizard, vacation planning, view switching, settings
- `playwright.config.ts` with dual webServer (Vite + Express)
- `npm run test:e2e` script
- **Component tests** — React Testing Library for Dashboard, ListView, FirstRunWizard, SettingsModal, VacationModal; 221 tests total
- **Pro-rata & leave-reduction utilities** — `computeProRataEntitlement`, `countFullCalendarMonths`, `computeLeaveReduction` (§ 4 BUrlG, § 17 BUrlG/BEEG); 44 tests
- **ICS generation utility** — RFC 5545 with line folding, escaping, year clipping; 20 tests

### Changed
- **TanStack Query frontend** — replaced Zustand persist + localStorage with `@tanstack/react-query` hooks backed by Express REST API
- New API layer: `src/api/client.ts` + `src/api/hooks.ts`
- Slim Zustand store — UI-only state (view, year, month, theme, language)
- All data persisted to SQLite via the API; no more localStorage
- **Dynamic school holidays** — fetches from `ferien-api.de`; 2025–2026 data retained as offline fallback
- **CSS refactor** — split 1090-line `App.css` into 8 co-located files; design tokens stay in `index.css`

### Fixed (post-release)
- Employment start/end date fields added to SettingsModal (were missing from UI)
- Effective entitlement (pro-rata + leave reduction) wired into Dashboard display
- `usedDays` counter now counts only `urlaub` type (not all vacation types)
- Import/export moved to settings modal; iCal export moved to list view
- API hardening: localhost bind, ICS carriage-return escaping, settings validation
- Scrollable modals on small screens; removed empty days hint; deduplicated list day count
- Toast store renamed (`useStore` → `useUIStore`)
- SQLite `data/` directory auto-created on first start
- Nav.css not imported in Nav.tsx
- Rules-of-Hooks violation in App.tsx
